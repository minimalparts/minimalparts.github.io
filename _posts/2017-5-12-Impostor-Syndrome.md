title: Impostor syndrome
---

The postdoc doesn't have impostor syndrome. Because to be an impostor, you have to expect some gain, and she's expecting none. Also she does't have any *group* of symptoms (see medical definition of 'syndrome'). She only has one emotion, which is 'Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!'\*<br><br>

\* But then again, the expression may not be fully compositional, and the meanings of 'impostor' and 'syndrome' may have shifted quite a lot in the lexicalisation process. She decides to test this by comparing the vectors of the phrase and the vectors of its constituents, using a range of composition functions and 1000 random initialisations of her predictive model.
