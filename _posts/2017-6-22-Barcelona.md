The postdoc has moved to Barcelona and she will readily admit that the travel guides did get it right, this time. The city is amazing.

What blows her mind, most of all, is that pedestrian lights go green *without needing to press a button*, and they *stay green* for quite a while. Which is remarkably handy when you're lost like a bloody tourist, trying to find the police station to submit your application for a so-called 'foreigner's number' that will be photocopied and attached to a online-downloable form to be submitted to the social security system, so you receive a number that will let you sign your damn work contract.

She crosses the same street for the third time, helplessly looking at a map, and the light is *still green*.

Wow. Barcelona.
