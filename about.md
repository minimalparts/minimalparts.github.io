### What is the Postdoc?

'The Postdoc' is a site about everyday postdoc experiences.



### What is a postdoc?

A postdoc is someone who has a doctor title that no one uses, not even the insurance company. The term 'postdoc' (prefix *post* and root *doc*) indicates that the person has passed a milestone (the *doc* bit) but cannot yet be called anything else that would be remotely meaningful. In effect, he or she is in limbo, waiting to be a referentiable entity again. The waiting typically lasts many years, in which a large proportion of postdocs turn irremediably mad.



### Are those stories true?

Yes, they are all 100% true. If you are interested in the various possible meanings of *true*, I recommend starting with the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth/) for an overview of the issue. Be warned that I myself do not entirely abide by the Tarskian notion of correspondence.
